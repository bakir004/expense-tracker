## Security & Reliability
- Rate limiting (protect APIs from abuse)
- Input validation (FluentValidation for request DTOs)
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- CORS configuration (restrict origins instead of AllowAnyOrigin)
- API key authentication for service-to-service calls

## Performance & Scalability
- Caching (Redis for frequently accessed data - user balances, categories)
- Pagination (add to all list endpoints - GET /transactions?page=1&pageSize=20)
- Response compression (enable gzip/brotli)
- Database indexing (add indexes on frequently queried columns - user_id, date, etc.)

## Developer Experience
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment)
- Health checks (detailed - database connectivity, external services)
- Metrics & monitoring (Prometheus metrics, Application Insights, or OpenTelemetry)
- API documentation enhancements (Swagger with examples, request/response samples)

- Reporting & analytics (endpoints for spending trends, category breakdowns, monthly summaries)
- Budget management (budgets per category with alerts)
- Recurring transactions (support for subscriptions/recurring expenses)
- Export functionality (export transactions to CSV/PDF)
- Search & filtering (advanced search with date ranges, amounts, categories)

## Code Quality
- Code coverage (aim for 80%+ coverage)
- Static analysis (SonarQube or similar)
- API contract testing (Pact or similar for frontend-backend contracts)
- Performance testing (load tests with k6 or JMeter)

## Infrastructure
- Environment configuration (separate configs for dev/staging/prod)
- Secrets management (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or HashiCorp Vault)
- Database migrations (use migration tool - EF Core Migrations or FluentMigrator)
- Backup strategy (automated database backups)

## User Experience
- Real-time updates (SignalR for live balance updates)
- Notifications (email/push notifications for budget alerts)
- Multi-currency support (handle different currencies)
- Receipt upload (store receipts with transactions)
